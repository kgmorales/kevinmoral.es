    title: 'Recipeek',
    description: `My family cooks a lot. We look up recipes almost daily. A lot of times though, those recipe sites are filled with ads that take up the entire screen. It becomes frustrating trying find something without constantly losing your place with page jumps from slow loads and pop ups. I decided to create an app to quick search recipes through an API that also searches YouTube's API for the corresponding video. I taught myself React & React Hooks and implemented this to be hosted using netlify.`,

    description: `This site was created because the company did not have any online
						presence. I was involved in everything. From conception to live push
						to maintenance. I travelled throughout the country with a co-worker
						to shoot all photos,video,interviews, etc. I created an online
						social presence while also creating content and maintaining
						marketing. During the time I made the company an extra $300k in
						sales in four months.`,

    description: `PetAg was made with the intention to inform the public about their
						products. A lot of research and process went into the design and UX
						of their main key target groups. While creating this I learned a
						alot about the cms we used, CRAFT CMS. I got more familiar with twig
						as I developed each page. It was also the first site I used using
						Foundation 6, which was new at the time and really learned the inner
						workings of the framework.`,

    title: 'Morales Wedding',
    description: `For my wedding, instead of paying for RSVP cards, mailing costs,
						last minute questions, and confusing scheduling of hotels for my
						wedding, I decided to make a website instead. This allowed me save
						money and provide a much more accessible hub of important
						information to my invited guests.`,

    description: `A site designed and developed around the concept of organizing a lot
						of content. The old site needed to be stripped and completely
						redone. With this in mind, the use of Wordpress CMS was used in
						order to keep track of all pages and posts. It needed to be easy for
						the internal team to maintain once it was pushed live.`,
