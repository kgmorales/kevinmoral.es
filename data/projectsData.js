    title: 'Recipeek',
    description: `My family cooks a lot. We look up recipes almost daily. A lot of times though, those recipe sites are filled with ads that take up the entire screen. It becomes frustrating trying find something without constantly losing your place with page jumps from slow loads and pop ups. I decided to create an app to quick search recipes through an API that also searches YouTube's API for the corresponding video. I taught myself React & React Hooks and implemented this to be hosted using netlify.`,

						social presence while also creating content and maintaining
						marketing. During the time I made the company an extra $300k in
						sales in four months.`,

    description: `PetAg was made with the intention to inform the public about their
						products. A lot of research and process went into the design and UX
						of their main key target groups. While creating this I learned a
						alot about the cms we used, CRAFT CMS. I got more familiar with twig
						as I developed each page. It was also the first site I used using
						Foundation 6, which was new at the time and really learned the inner
						workings of the framework.`,

						the internal team to maintain once it was pushed live.`,

						deadline. The project was to be front end only and to be handed off
						to another development firm to be implemented within a custom CMS. I
						had to create instructions on how to function throughout the code
